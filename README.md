# What is it?

- The Databoard is a custom devboard that excels in data collection, having many things that would make it useful
- External RTC crystal (`Real Time Clock`) for accurate time-keeping

- WIFI to sync up the RTC or compare values from APIs

# Why did I design it?

- I had already made another devboard before, but I wanted to challenge myself more, and I did this by trying to make a design as slim as possible and as cheap as possible, which was wildy different from my previous project.

- Another way I challenged myself was in the features, especially with a chip with not as good documentation as the RP2040. Instead of things being a straight-forward step by step process, I had to actually read the documentation in depth, and be able to quickly use the Table of Contents to find out where the information I need is.

# Challenges

- Honestly, the there weren't that many that were excruciatingly difficult for this project. I believe this was because of the time that I spent placing the components in pretty good spots. This made it easy, for the most part, to route the traces, as long as I picked which ones should be more valued and more direct
